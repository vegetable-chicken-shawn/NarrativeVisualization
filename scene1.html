                    Most international computer science students must follow a series of steps to study, live, and work in the United States.

                    A common path to obtaining permanent residency in the U.S. involves transitioning from an F1 visa (student) to OPT (temporary work authorization), then to an H1-B visa (special work authorization), and finally to becoming a permanent resident.

                <li class="text_list_item">
                    One of the biggest uncertainties is the H1-B visa, as international students and workers must participate in a lottery for the visa, and not everyone secures one within the 3 years of OPT status.

                <li class="text_list_item">
                    Each year, 65,000 general seats and 20,000 higher degree seats are available for H1-B visa applications. The chart below shows the number of registrations received by USCIS for H1-B petitions.
